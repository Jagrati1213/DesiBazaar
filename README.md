# DesiBazar E-Commerce Website
DesiBazar is an e-commerce website built using React.js, React Router, Ant Design, local storage for data persistence, authentication for secure user access, and Redux Toolkit for state management. This project aims to provide a seamless and efficient online shopping experience with a focus on Desi products.

## Tech stack :

- **React.js:** DesiBazar is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient component-based development, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.

- **React Router:** Navigation in DesiBazar is powered by React Router, enabling a smooth and dynamic user experience by managing URL navigation and rendering of components based on the route.

- **Ant Design:** The user interface of DesiBazar is designed using Ant Design, a React UI library with a set of high-quality components. Ant Design ensures a visually appealing and responsive design for the e-commerce platform.

- **Local Storage:** Data persistence is achieved through local storage, allowing users to have a seamless experience across multiple sessions. This ensures that their shopping cart, preferences, and other relevant data are retained even after closing and reopening the browser.

- **Authentication:** DesiBazar employs user authentication to ensure secure access to user-specific features and information. This feature enhances the overall security of the platform and allows for a personalized experience.
